# Lin

Lin is an Android Lint tool made simpler. It has two different goals:

1. To create a set of highly opinionated rules to apply to your Android projects.
2. To offer a Kotlin DSL to write your own rules in a much easier way.

## How to use

Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
